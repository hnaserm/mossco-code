The MOSSCO project is funded primarly by the German Ministry for Education and Research
(BMBF) in the frame of its Coastal research agenda North and Baltic Sea (KÃ¼NO) within the
Research Agenda for Sustainability (FONA).

The participating institutes---HZG, IOW, and BAW---all contribute with institutional funding
to the success of MOSSCO.

The Friends of Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht helped finance the Modular Coupling Workshop
held in 2013.

MOSSCO initated code changes both in the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) developed by 
Burchard & Bolding, and in the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) developed
by Jorn Bruggeman.  We acknowledge the cooperation with these developers.

The MOSSCO web site and development platform is hosted by sf.net for free.  We thank the sponsors 
of sf.net for enabling this service to operate.

MOSSCO makes use of many free and open source software projects, among  them the GNU project 
and the Earth System Modeling Framework, the Python scripting language and the Inkscape vector
drawing program.  MOSSCO is mainly developed on Ubuntu Linux workstations.
