This is the main directory of MOSSCO, also called $MOSSCO_DIR

The overarching goal of the project "Modular System for Shelves and Coasts" (MOSSCO) is to bring
together the distributed capacities in coastal ocean modelling in Germany and to build a common
infrastructure for the national and international coastal research community. 

The software MOSSCO implements this infrastructure in the form of a library of components and couplers,
and of example coupled applications.  The components "wrap" external models used in coastal and
shelf sciences, such as the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemistry (FABM), the General Ocean Turbulence
Model (GOTM), or the Delft3D erosion model.  These wrapped components are then coupled to each other 
in the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF).

################################################################

This main directory $MOSSCO_DIR contains three subdirectories
./src for the library of wrappers, components, and couplers
./doc for documentation
./examples for example applications

#################################################################
To make the documentation with full installation instructions, type

> make doc

to generate a pdf file in $MOSSCO_DIR/doc/mossco_documentation.pdf and a html version at $MOSSCO_DIR/doc/html/index.html
There is also an online documentation at http://www.mossco.de/doc with detailed
installation instructions.

##################################################################
To make the MOSSCO libraries, i.e. drivers, components, and utilities, you need to have
- a copy of the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemistry Models (FABM) at the location 
  specified in the $FABMDIR environment variable, and with a variable $FORTRAN_COMPILER 
  set to GFORTRAN or IFORT (consult the FABM documentation for more options). 
- a compiled version of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF), with known location of
  the esmf.mk Makefile pointed to by the variable $ESMFMKFILE 

Then, simply type

> make

To make some examples, type

> make examples

Should you encounter errors or annoyances (such that this just does not work out of the box, 
please consult the documentation, and visit the bugs database at https://sourceforge.net/p/mossco/tickets)
