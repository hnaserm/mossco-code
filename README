This is the main directory of MOSSCO, also called $MOSSCO_DIR

Goal of the project "Modular System for Shelves and Coasts" (MOSSCO) is to bring
together the distributed capacities in coastal ocean modelling in Germany and to 
build a common infrastructure for the international coastal research community. 

The software MOSSCO implements this infrastructure in the form of a library of components and couplers, and of example coupled applications.  The components "wrap" external models used in coastal and shelf sciences, such as the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemistry (FABM), the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM), or the Delft3D erosion model (EROSED).  These wrapped components are then coupled to each other in the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF).

################################################################

This main directory $MOSSCO_DIR contains three subdirectories
./src for the library of drivers, components, and couplers
./doc for documentation
./examples for example applications to be used as templates

#################################################################
To make the documentation with full installation instructions, type

> make doc

This generates a pdf file in $MOSSCO_DIR/doc/mossco_documentation.pdf and a html version at $MOSSCO_DIR/doc/html/index.html. There is also a pre-built online documentation at http://www.mossco.de/doc with detailed installation instructions, if your system is missing latex/doxygen for building the documentation yourself.

##################################################################
To make the MOSSCO libraries, i.e. drivers, components, and utilities, you need to have
a compiled version of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF), with known location of the esmf.mk Makefile pointed to by the variable $ESMFMKFILE 

Then, simply type

> make

To make some examples, type

> make examples

Should you encounter errors or annoyances (such that this just does not work out of the box, 
please consult the documentation, and visit the bugs database at https://sourceforge.net/p/mossco/tickets)
 
####################################################################
More components and examples are built when FABM, GOTM, GETM, or EROSED are installed 
on your system.  Please consult the documentation for information on how to build
MOSSCO with any of these external models.
