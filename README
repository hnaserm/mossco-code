This is the main directory of MOSSCO, also called $MOSSCODIR

[put here information about authors, funding, and ....]

This main directory contains three subdirectories for source code, documentation, and examples

To make the documentation, type

> make doc

to generate a pdf file in $MOSSCODIR/doc/mossco_documentation.pdf and a html version at $MOSSCODIR/doc/html/index.html

To make the MOSSCO libraries, i.e. drivers, components, and utilities, you need to have a copy of the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemistry Models (FABM) at the location specified in the $FABMDIR environment variable, and you need to set the variable $FORTRAN_COMPILER to GFORTRAN or IFORT (consult the FABM documentation for more options).  Then, simply type

> make

To make some examples, type

> make examples

Should you encounter errors or annoyances (such that this just does not work out of the box, please consult the documentation, and visit the bugs database at https://sourceforge.net/p/mossco/tickets)
