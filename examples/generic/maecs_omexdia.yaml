# This configuration describes a coupling between pelagic and sediment ecology (both
# implemented through FABM models
coupling:
 - components: 
   - gotm       # The ocean in 1D (physics)
   - fabm_gotm  # The ocean biogeochemistry, choose models in fabm.nml
   interval: 360 s # The coupling interval of these two components
 - components:
   - fabm_gotm
   - pelagic_benthic_coupler # The special coupler between pelagial and benthos
   - fabm_sediment
   interval: 6 m
 - components:
   - fabm_sediment
   - benthic_pelagic_coupler
   - fabm_gotm
   interval:  6 m
 - components:
   - constant # This component delivers needed constant values, e.g oxygen
   - fabm_sediment
   interval: 360 d
